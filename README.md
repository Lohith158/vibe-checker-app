# 🧠 Vibe Checker — AI Sentiment Analysis App

## 📌 Project Overview

**Vibe Checker** is a simple AI-powered web app that analyzes text and detects whether the sentiment is **Positive** or **Negative**.

This project was built as part of my learning journey in AI and deployment.
The goal was to understand how real-world AI models can be integrated into web applications and deployed to the cloud for public use.

## 📚 What I Learned

This project helped me understand:

* How pre-trained NLP models work (sentiment analysis)
* Using Hugging Face `pipeline()` in real applications
* Building interactive AI apps with Streamlit
* Managing dependencies using `requirements.txt`
* Deploying AI projects to the cloud using GitHub + Streamlit
* Debugging real deployment issues
